    CI/CD Pipelines: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.

    
Team Roles

    Backend Developer: 
    Back-end developers implement the core of an app—its algorithms and business logic. Experienced back-end developers not only write code but also do the tasks of an architect—for example, devise an app architecture or design and implement the necessary integrations. Responsible for implementing API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic.

    Database Administrator:
    Administrator (DBA), is responsible for managing, securing, and maintaining an organization's data infrastructure. This includes designing database systems, ensuring their smooth operation, and guaranteeing data safety and reliability. They work to ensure data is accessible to users when needed and that new databases integrate well with existing ones. Manages database design, indexing, and optimizations.
    
    DevOps Engineer:
    DevOps engineers serve as a link between the two teams, unifying and automating the software delivery process and helping strike a balance between introducing changes quickly and keeping an application stable. Working together with software developers, system administrators, and operational staff, DevOps engineers oversee and facilitate code releases on a CI/CD basis. Handles deployment, monitoring, and scaling of the backend services.
    
    QA Engineer:
    Ensures the backend functionalities are thoroughly tested and meet quality standards.

Database Design

    Users: The user will have field such as name, id, age, and address. User will have one to many relationship with properties i.e a user can have multiple properties while a property can only be own by a user at a time.

    Properties: Property will have field such as description, location, price, availability. It will have a many to many relationship with bookings and also with reviews.

    Bookings: Booking will have a user field (a foreign key to User entity), date, payment status.

    Reviews: Reviews will have fields such as name, comment, date.

    Payments: Payment will have fields such as name, details, address e.t.c.

API Security

    API security is the practice of protecting application programming interfaces (APIs) from cyberattacks and data breaches. It involves implementing measures to ensure that only authorized users can access and utilize APIs, and that the data transmitted through them is protected from unauthorized access or modification. Effective API security is crucial because APIs are often the entry points for sensitive data and functionality within applications. 

    Why is API security important?

    Data Protection:
    APIs handle sensitive data like user information, financial records, and other critical assets. Securing APIs is essential to prevent data breaches and leaks. 
    Service Availability:
    APIs are often the backbone of applications and systems. Protecting them from attacks like denial-of-service (DoS) ensures their availability and prevents disruptions to services. 
    Preventing Exploits:
    API vulnerabilities can be exploited to gain unauthorized access, manipulate data, or disrupt services. Robust security practices help mitigate these risks. 

    Key Aspects of API Security:

    Authentication:
    Verifying the identity of the user or application making the API request. 
    Authorization:
    Determining what resources the authenticated user or application is permitted to access. 
    Data Protection:
    Encrypting data in transit (e.g., using HTTPS) and at rest to prevent unauthorized access or modification. 
    Input Validation:
    Ensuring that all data received through API requests is valid and safe, preventing injection attacks. 
    Rate Limiting:
    Implementing mechanisms to limit the number of requests from a specific user or application, preventing abuse and denial-of-service attacks. 
    Monitoring and Logging:
    Continuously monitoring API traffic for suspicious activity and logging events for analysis and investigation. 
    Regular Security Audits:
    Periodically assessing the API's security posture to identify and address vulnerabilities. 
    API Gateways:
    Utilizing API gateways to manage and secure API traffic, enforcing security policies, and providing centralized control. 

CI/CD Pipeline

    A CI/CD pipeline is a series of automated steps that streamline the software development process, integrating code changes and delivering them to production. It combines continuous integration (CI) with continuous delivery or deployment (CD), enabling faster and more reliable software releases. 

    Key Concepts:

    Continuous Integration (CI):
    Developers frequently merge their code changes into a central repository, and automated builds and tests are triggered to identify integration issues early. 

    Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD):
    Automated processes handle the release of code changes to various environments, such as testing or production. Continuous delivery stops short of automatic production deployment, while continuous deployment automatically releases updates. 

    Benefits of CI/CD Pipelines:

    Faster Release Cycles:
    Automation speeds up the development process, allowing for quicker delivery of new features and bug fixes. 
    Improved Software Quality:
    Early and frequent testing helps identify and resolve issues early, leading to higher quality software. 
    Reduced Risks:
    Automation minimizes manual errors and streamlines the deployment process, reducing the risk of deployment failures. 
    Increased Collaboration:
    CI/CD pipelines foster collaboration between development and operations teams through a shared workflow. 
    Reduced Costs:
    By automating tasks and reducing errors, CI/CD pipelines can help reduce development and operational costs. 

    Tools:
    Many tools support CI/CD pipelines, including Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, CircleCI, and more.
