AirBnB Clone Project Overview

The backend for the Airbnb Clone project is designed to provide a robust and scalable foundation for managing user interactions, property listings, bookings, and payments. This backend will support various functionalities required to mimic the core features of Airbnb, ensuring a smooth experience for users and hosts.

Project Goals

    User Management: Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.
    Property Management: Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.
    Booking System: Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.
    Payment Processing: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.
    Review System: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.
    Data Optimization: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.

Technology Stack

    Django: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.
    Django REST Framework: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
    PostgreSQL: A powerful relational database used for data storage.
    GraphQL: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
    Celery: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
    Redis: Used for caching and session management.
    Docker: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
    CI/CD Pipelines: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.

    
Team Roles

    Backend Developer: 
    Back-end developers implement the core of an app—its algorithms and business logic. Experienced back-end developers not only write code but also do the tasks of an architect—for example, devise an app architecture or design and implement the necessary integrations. Responsible for implementing API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic.

    Database Administrator:
    Administrator (DBA), is responsible for managing, securing, and maintaining an organization's data infrastructure. This includes designing database systems, ensuring their smooth operation, and guaranteeing data safety and reliability. They work to ensure data is accessible to users when needed and that new databases integrate well with existing ones. Manages database design, indexing, and optimizations.
    
    DevOps Engineer:
    DevOps engineers serve as a link between the two teams, unifying and automating the software delivery process and helping strike a balance between introducing changes quickly and keeping an application stable. Working together with software developers, system administrators, and operational staff, DevOps engineers oversee and facilitate code releases on a CI/CD basis. Handles deployment, monitoring, and scaling of the backend services.
    
    QA Engineer:
    Ensures the backend functionalities are thoroughly tested and meet quality standards.

Database Design

    Users: The user will have field such as name, id, age, and address. User will have one to many relationship with properties i.e a user can have multiple properties while a property can only be own by a user at a time.

    Properties: Property will have field such as description, location, price, availability. It will have a many to many relationship with bookings and also with reviews.

    Bookings: Booking will have a user field (a foreign key to User entity), date, payment status.

    Reviews: Reviews will have fields such as name, comment, date.

    Payments: Payment will have fields such as name, details, address e.t.c.
